# Property Management Application

## Rental Agreements and Documentation:

Allow users to generate rental agreements electronically. You can provide templates or a customizable form where users can input the necessary details and generate a PDF version of the agreement.

Implement a document management system to store and organize rental agreements securely. Assign unique identifiers to each agreement for easy retrieval and tracking.

## Tenant Management:
Create a tenant management module where users can store and manage tenant information, including contact details, lease terms, and rental history.
Implement a dashboard or interface to view tenant details, upcoming lease expirations, and payment status.
Send automated notifications to tenants for rent payment reminders, lease renewal offers, or important updates.

## Payment Processing:
Integrate a payment gateway to securely process rent payments from tenants. Popular payment gateways include Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree.
Provide a payment interface where tenants can enter their payment details and initiate transactions.
Implement recurring payment options for automatic rent deductions.

## Maintenance and Issue Tracking:
Develop a ticketing system for tenants to report maintenance issues or repair requests. Users should be able to submit details, attach images, and categorize the urgency of the request.
Assign tickets to property managers or maintenance staff for resolution.
Implement a status tracking system to monitor the progress of maintenance requests and notify tenants about updates.

## Notifications and Reminders:
Set up an automated notification system to send reminders and alerts to tenants for upcoming rent payments, lease expirations, or scheduled maintenance.
Use email or SMS notifications based on tenant preferences or system settings.
Provide an interface for users to configure their notification preferences.

## Reporting and Analytics:
Develop reporting capabilities to generate insights and analytics on various aspects of the rental management system.
Generate reports on property occupancy rates, rental income, outstanding payments, or maintenance request response times.
Display visualizations such as charts and graphs to provide a clear overview of the data.

## Integration with External Systems:
Identify the external systems you want to integrate with, such as accounting software or CRM tools.
Establish API connections or utilize webhook notifications to exchange data between your rental management system and the external systems.
Examples of integrations could include syncing rental payment data with accounting software or importing tenant information from a CRM tool.
